        <h3>Research Projects</h3><br/>
        <p>Technology has can be a powerful tool for equity and social justice. However, in its current state, technological development largely ossifies pre-existing structural inequity. Exploring the radical potential of technology is the motivation for Unplugged’s Research Program.</p><br/>
        <p>We are deeply excited to explore research that recognizes and focuses on processes, rather than products, as the true locus of creativity and development, and believe shifting our focus to processes will have a revolutionary impact on the humaneness of economic development.</p>

    <h1>Stingray Usage</h1>
    <p>Those at the fringes of society are often the first to be affected by aggressive policing tactics. In this project, we seek to better understand how low income and minority populations may be disproportionately targeted by a form of surveillance called Stingrays.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices">Stingrays aka IMSI catchers,</a> are devices that effectively imitate cell phone towers and are used by law enforcement to track  the location call history, and even content of individuals’ cell phones. Furthermore, Stingrays  pick up information from all phones in range of the device, not just the phone they’re targeting.These devices are clouded in secrecy. Given recent revelations concerning law enforcement in America, this project is an effort to shed light on their use.</p>
    <p>This is done using a modified version of an <a href="https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector">Android application</a> that analyzes known cell tower locations, signal strength, and other variables in order to inform users whether it is likely their device is in range of a Stingray. Our <a href="https://github.com/marvinmarnold/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector">modified version</a> of the application uploads anonymous data so that we can map threats and better understand Stingray use within low-income communities and communities of color.</p>
    <p><b>WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND STILL AT BLEEDING ALPHA!</b></p>
